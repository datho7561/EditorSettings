# EditorSettings

These are common settings I use for editors I use. 
Theses are my `dotfiles`, I just hadn't heard that terminology used for them when I made this repo.
It contains:

1. My .vimrc and a list of the plugins I generally use
2. My VSCode settings
3. My bash aliases
4. Some scripts I have written and use:
    * bad_lint.sh, a simple C++ linter that points out some common issues I have run into
